# Infrrd
This repository contains the code and resources for solving an entity extraction task, where the goal is to extract specific entities from a dataset containing images and .tsv files. The project involves several key steps, starting with setting up a Python environment with the necessary libraries, which include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, spacy, transformers, tensorflow, and torch. After setting up the environment, you will explore the data by loading the .tsv files, followed by data preprocessing, where you normalize the data to prepare it for model input. For model building, you can start with simple models like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or BiLSTM-CRF, using libraries like sklearn-crfsuite. Once the model is trained, predictions can be made on the test data, and results saved to a .tsv file. Model evaluation is done using the provided eval.py script, which compares the predictions against the ground truth. Post-evaluation, error analysis is crucial for refining the model, with the option to try advanced models like BERT using the transformers library. The entire process, including assumptions, preprocessing steps, model details, error analysis, and refinements, should be thoroughly documented
